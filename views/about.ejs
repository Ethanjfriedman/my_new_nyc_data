      <p>MyNYCData is an interactive tool for visualizing NYC governmental data, supplied by <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us">NYC Open Data</a>.</p>
      <p>We believe New York City's data is a public resource that should be easily accessible and viewable by all, and have
        chosen to start by rendering selected datasets on police-civilian interactions as easy-to-use, customizable charts, in
        three different formats: multiple timeseries, pie chart (single year or an animated year-by-year progression), and
        bar chart (again, by single year or as an animated multi-year progression).</p>
      <p>We hope to add more datasets, and more forms of visualization as this project progresses. It was originally conceived as a
        project for <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly's</a> New York-based Web Development Immersive (WDI) course.
